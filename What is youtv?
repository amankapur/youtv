# Physical Manifestation of Social Networks
Matt Belland, Aman Kapur, Alec Radford, Jessica Sutantio


## Abstract: 

Currently in the digital age, our lives revolve around social networking,
comparable to the way that previous generations revolved their lives around
visual media such as television. As a statement on this divide between our
generations, we will bridge this digital and analog gap by creating a physical
interface for these social networking sites (such as Facebook, Youtube, and
Twitter). We will allow users to interact with these sites in a fashion that
nostalgically recalls interactivity with an old dial television by embedding
tangible mechanisms such as buttons and a slider that interface with the digital
systems.

## Description and Work: 

To start with we take an old 1975(ish) wood construction CRT TV which we have
already acquired and gut the old CRT/electronics internals. After this we will
begin building our social network box (with a first focus of delivering a
youtube experience) by mounting an LCD panel inside and powering the system with
a Raspberry Pi we have already acquired. Additionally, we will work on extensive
mechanical modifications to incorporate our unique features notably and
primarily a physical youtube slider which mimics the functionality of the
software slider. Depending on the success of this portion, we will look into
incorporating additional websites/social networks and mechanical elements. 

## Mechanical: Jess
In order to create the Youtube Progress Bar, we use a combination of a timing
belt and pulleys, one powered by either pairing a motor and potentiometer or a
motorized potentiometer. This allows the bar to move automatically as the video
progresses, dragging along a red bar or strip. However, when the user desires to
drag the slider in a different direction or at his or her desired speed, the
potentiometer will detect the change in velocity, thus disengaging the motor and
allowing the bar to be hand driven.
For possible future integration, the bar is designed so that the moving red
point on the bar may be a button itself. This is possible because the bar is
attached to a metal rail, thus avoiding the immediate interference of the timing
belt itself. With the rail, the system is more stable, allowing a button to be
implemented without placing any perpendicular force on the timing belt.

To maintain the look of a Youtube video, the pause and play function will be
controlled by a uniform button placed on the left of the progress bar. We will
use an LED matrix so that the display can switch between the pause and play
logos depending on the video’s current state.

Beside the progress bar and buttons, the rest of the mechanical aspects of this
project is focused on making the system user friendly and self explanatory.
Also, all systems should be seamlessly integrated within our television set.

Software: Alec, Aman, Matt
The Raspberry Pi is an ARM based platform that is relatively robust - allowing
us a great deal of flexibility in our approach to handling the software side of
the project. We hope to build a combination physical/software user interface as
a wrapper to the various sites we hope to eventually integrate - beginning with
Youtube.

The goal here is to link the gap between the electrical inputs from the physical
interface and the world of youtube. We aim to run a mini ruby web server on the
Pi which will handle the serial inputs and respond with a html page with the
appropriate results. This will be displayed on a browser to the user. This also
gives us the ability to design an awesome retro looking visual display for the
user. 

The youtube data API is powerful and gives is more than required information
regarding each type of query. We plan to use their REST API to aid the user to
search for videos and then rate, comment, and even subscribe to their favorite
youtubers. This API layer is the middle ground between the mechanical components
of the system and the virtual world of online videos. This will run on the mini
server on the Pi and hence will be written in Ruby. 

Electrical: Alec, Aman
Electrical will primarily be using the GPIO pins on Raspberry Pi to detect
interaction as well as driving/controlling the mechanical elements. If the GPIO
pins on the Raspberry Pi proves difficult to work with, using an arduino
communicating to the Raspberry PI over usb would be a fall back.
Additionally various small tasks will be involved with the acquisition of a
monitor for display, and setting up/soldering various wiring for buttons and
power, etc...

## Project Budget

The major component is the physical structure of the device. Our current
estimates are $125 for mechanical parts such as motors, timing belts, pulleys,
and basic stock metal,  and about $50 for electrical components such as LEDs,
potentiometer, resistors, wiring, etc. $25 will be used to purchase a used
monitor for display.
Our primary source for ordering mechanical parts is McMaster and for electrical
components which aren’t available in PoE lab, we plan to order from the ECE
stockroom.
Budgets usually have an inclination to overflow and hence we have a $50 buffer.
Our plan for the project is based on iterations and this extra buffer if unused
can be useful to add another exciting feature to the system.

## Retirement Plan: 

We would definitely like to showcase the result in some form or fashion.
It will be designed so as to be self-contained where, once set-up, the
only maintenance/resources needed will be internet access and
electricity. The immediately obvious path would be an art gallery or
installation somewhere. However, we would likeu to consider attempting to
work the media and internet for viral exposure
